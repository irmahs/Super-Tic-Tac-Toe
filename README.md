# Super Tic-Tac-Toe

A fun and engaging game of Tic-Tac-Toe with multiple sections, complex gameplay mechanics, and a competitive twist! Players alternate turns to conquer different planetary sections, filling them up with either a "pink" or "purple" marker. The first player to conquer a section by filling all the buttons in a Tic-Tac-Toe winning combination wins the game!

## Features

- **Multiple Sections**: The game is divided into multiple planetary sections (e.g., Mercury, Venus, Mars, etc.) where players place their markers.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players take turns clicking on buttons, changing their colors to either pink or purple.
- **Win Condition**: Players win by completing a row, column, or diagonal with their marker color in each section.
- **Celebration Toast**: Once a player wins, a celebration toast appears with fireworks and a victory message.
